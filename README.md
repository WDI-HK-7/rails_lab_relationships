Playing with Relationships in Rails

#### Solution

```
$ git checkout `solution`
```

There is a `solution` script to run all the generators and setup your database
```
$ ./solution
```

You'll then have to add the reverse relationships to your model (as specified in `db/seeds.rb`)

Then to test,simply run:

```
$ rake db:seed
```
